The repository structure has three main components:
1. the folder "src" where you can find the .py scripts that implement all the ingredients of the paper (e.g.: random network model, recommenders, etc.). 
2. the folder "Simulation_scripts" contains a unique .py file that you need to invoke to run all the experiments.
3. the jupyter notebook "ANALYSIS.ipynb" in the root folder reproduces all the visualizations shown in the paper. Run it only after you have run correctly all the needed experiments.
